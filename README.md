# RabbitMQ and MassTransit Implementations

This repository contains example implementations of messaging systems using RabbitMQ and MassTransit, completed as part of university coursework.

## Project Folders

Below is a list of the main project folders. Each folder contains its own `README.md` file, which provides a detailed description of the specific tasks and requirements for that part of the project.

*   **`mass-transit-commands-and-advanced`**: Demonstrates advanced MassTransit features, including commands, error handling, message observers, and encrypted communication.
*   **`mass-transit-publish-subscribe`**: Focuses on the publish/subscribe pattern using MassTransit, including different consumer types and message versioning.
*   **`mass-transit-sagas`**: Implements a distributed order processing system using MassTransit Sagas, showcasing asynchronous communication, timeouts, and state management.
*   **`rabbit-mq`**: Contains examples of basic RabbitMQ functionalities, such as senders, receivers, headers, competing consumers, acknowledgments, and the publish/subscribe pattern directly with the RabbitMQ client.

**Note:** All tasks described within each project's `README.md` have been implemented. However, please be aware that some subfolder names within these projects might not perfectly reflect their content due to the nature of the coursework assignments.
